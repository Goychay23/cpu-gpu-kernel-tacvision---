Use the rootinitkernel.sh file for installation. This tool does not provide full CPU segment control, only the added segment is added as a subkernel.Most functions in this tool are for speeding up and adding cpu segment.I mean, CPU kernel optimization is not done much, it is added as a subkernel module and thus system integration is in terms of CPU and GPU.
